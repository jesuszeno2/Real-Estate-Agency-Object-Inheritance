# Real Estate Agency Object Inheritance
This application (main) creates 2 agents objects. Next, I create 3 different types of
properties (2 houses, 1 apartment) and distribute them among the 2 agents. Third, I iterate through the list
of agents (objects) and print every agentâ€™s properties, listing the property type , rent, and address.
